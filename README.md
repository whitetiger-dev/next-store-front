```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

Set environment variables:  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN=woohoobigtoken`  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_NAME=statikly` (as in statikly.myshopify.com)

Run Development:

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
npm run dev
```

Run Production:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

or

```
npm run build
npm start
```
