### Use with Shopify

Get a Shopify _storefront_ api access token. The best way is to [create a private app](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api/getting-started#private).

Set environment variables:  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN=woohoobigtoken`  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_NAME=statikly` (as in statikly.myshopify.com)

### Use With Stripe

Set environment variables:  
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

Create some products by adding `.json` files to the `products` directory.
